# web_pwa-boilerplate
A progressive web app boilerplate that demonstrates some of the coolest capabilities of PWAs. Created by üêè @peltogle üêè [(my website)](http://peltogle.com)

## What & Why?
This boilerplate is meant to be a baseline for some of the coolest features that a progressive web app is capable of doing. No frameworks will be used for this boilerplate as that defies the point of a boiler plate. More features will be added as I discover new capabilities.
